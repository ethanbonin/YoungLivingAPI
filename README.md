# YoungLiving API
----------------

## Reason for the API

I created this API because I wanted to create some awesome stuff for my mom. She uses Young Living on a daily basis, 
and from what I could tell, she wanted more condensed and consise tools with Young Living.

## Final Note before using

You have to start with __/yl/login/__ before you can do anything. It will return back an authtoken that you will use for any requests.
